# Sign-Language-Controlled-Robot-Capstone-Project
This repository contains the files produced towards my capstone project, creating a robot controlled by sign language.

The notebook main_client.ipynb is the script to run on your nearby laptop and main_server.py is meant to run on the raspberry pi controlling the GoPiGo robot. First run the server script to open the port and then run the script from the local laptop to establish the connection.
